# Learning Notes

This repository is my personal knowledge base.

I write here to better understand and remember what I’m learning in programming and computer science. Writing is part of my learning process — this is **not** a collection of polished tutorials or authoritative explanations.

Topics are not fixed. I write about whatever I’m studying at the moment, and this repository evolves naturally over time.

Most notes are written first in **Portuguese (PT-BR)**, because it helps me think more clearly while learning. Some of them are later translated to **English (EN)** when it makes sense.

The long-term idea is to slowly turn this into a kind of **living, digital book**: a growing collection of concepts, explanations, mistakes, and insights that reflect what I’ve learned over time.

If you’re reading this expecting perfection, this repo is not for that.
If you’re curious about how someone learns and thinks through technical topics, welcome.
